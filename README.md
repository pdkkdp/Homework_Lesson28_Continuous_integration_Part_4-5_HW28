# Node.js Application CI/CD Pipeline

This project demonstrates setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application using Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub.

## Project Description

The repository contains a sample Node.js application integrated with a complete CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline automates code building, dependency installation, testing, and deployment steps, using npm as the package manager.

## Features

- **Source code management** with GitHub.
- **Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment** (CI/CD) using Jenkins Pipeline.
- **Automated build, test, and deploy** steps.
- **Dockerfile** for building container images.
- **Parallel build and deployment** on a remote server.
- **Development environment** setup with Visual Studio Code (VSC).

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Checkout**: Clone the source code from GitHub.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install Node.js and project dependencies with `npm install`.
3. **Build**: Run the application build process (if applicable).
4. **Test**: Execute automated tests (using npm test or similar).
5. **Docker Build**: Build a Docker image for the application.
6. **Deploy**: Deploy the Docker container to a remote server.
7. **Reporting**: Publish build and test reports.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Repository**:  
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.  
   - Add your application source code.

2. **Docker**:  
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for building your Node.js app image.

3. **Visual Studio Code (VSC)**:  
   - Install VSC on your computer.
   - Open your project in VSC.
   - Install recommended extensions:
     - For Node.js: JavaScript/TypeScript support, ESLint.
     - For CI/CD: Jenkins Pipeline Linter, GitLens, or similar.

4. **Version Control**:  
   - Configure Git or GitLens extension in VSC for source control.

5. **Code Quality**:  
   - Set up auto-formatting and linting (e.g., ESLint) in VSC for real-time code checking.

6. **CI/CD Integration**:  
   - Configure Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to automate your pipeline steps.
   - Connect your project repository to your chosen CI/CD system.

7. **Remote Deployment**:  
   - Set up your remote server for Docker deployment.
   - Enable parallel build and deployment (if required by your assignment).

8. **Pipeline Execution**:  
   - Run your pipeline.
   - Monitor build, test, and deploy results.
   - Optimize pipeline performance using parallel steps where possible.
